You realize, as me, that you're leaving each day of our life in a hurry. Which is funny, life is meant to be slow, since you'll die, in the end. That's why I created SlowThings Down, Inspirare by professor who asks his student to go to the near musem and stare a painting of choice for three hours.

Why? That's an interesting question, maybe because we don't really mesure, how worse is our focus. But, if you like me, don't have acess to musem or just don't like to go outise and staying looking at a paiting for three hours (maybe while poeple thinkg you're crazy), you can bee crazy at your home! That's why this project even exists.
